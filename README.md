# Aruco-Marker-Detection
Aruco marker detection is a project that utilizes the OpenCV library to identify and track Aruco markers in real-time. Aruco markers are square fiducial markers that are composed of a black border and an inner binary matrix. The binary matrix encodes the marker's ID, which can be used to distinguish between multiple markers. The project utilizes a Raspberry Pi camera to capture video frames, which are then processed by the OpenCV library to detect Aruco markers. Once a marker is detected, its ID and position are displayed on the screen. The project also demonstrates how to track Aruco markers over time, by maintaining a list of detected markers and updating their positions in each frame. This allows for applications such as augmented reality, where virtual objects can be overlaid onto the real world based on the position of Aruco markers.
